\acks We would like to thank Patrick LaVictoire for facilitating the
workshop where most of the initial ideas originated, Matt Brown for
helping us discover the reason that the self-interpreter for
F$_\omega$ doesn't contradict this formalization of LÓ§b's theorem, and
Adam Chlipala for timely and helpful suggestions on the writing of
this paper.
